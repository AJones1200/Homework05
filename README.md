I created a moment in javascript to add the date to the header of the page

I will create a moment/ function to change the color of the time blocks based on the event status (present, past, future)

I created an array for the times needed in the planner

I created a for loop to iterate over the items in each time and save them in local storage

I created rows and columns using bootstrap formatting

I created save buttons with jQuery event listeners

I appended the elements to the page
